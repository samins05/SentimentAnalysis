I'm really enjoying these headphones so far, even after trying AirPods Max and Sony XM4. The QC45 just feel more comfortable to me, which may vary by individual. If you check out the RTINGS comparison you'll find the sound is actually better than the XM4 and they use scientific methods of comparison, not just throwing them on and making a judgement call. I agree that Bose should offer more customization to suit personal preference but that's an easy thing to add later in a software update. Noise cancelling beats the XM4 in my opinion and perhaps tied or exceeds AirPods Max -- tough to say. If you value comfort and plan to wear these for extending periods definitely consider this model. Don't get a QC35 like some have said, no USB-C, older technology in general, and QC35 probably won't get much software support going forward (being the old model).Update 01/11/2022: Still loving these headphones! I've taken them on several trips (including air travel) and they've performed very well. Battery life is long and they can simultaneously connect to multiple devices so you can pair them with a laptop, phone, tablet, etc without fiddling much with bluetooth settings. Noise cancellation makes the cabin noise in a plane much more tolerable and the controls with physical buttons are fantastic compared to both Sony and Apple competition. I have not tried the Bose NC700, but I am very particular to headphone comfort and design and I don't believe I would find them as nice to wear for long durations. Mic quality seems to be great, I use them in meetings frequently and have listened to myself through the mic to test. It won't compete with a standalone microphone, but nonetheless good for a wireless option.Update 07/14/2022: Since purchase Bose has added equalizer settings via a software update (to allow you to tweak the sound), eliminating one of my original complaints entirely. The Sony XM5 have also released. I can’t speak to how good the XM5 is, but know this — the XM5 is more expensive and no longer folds down to a compact form like the XM4 before it. Losing the ability to fold up automatically eliminates the XM5 from consideration for me personally. Traveling with the bulky case of the XM5 does not seem appealing.Update 11/16/2022: The headphones are still going strong! Over the past year I've been using these headphones almost every day. If you're going to use these headphones for meetings be aware that the microphone quality over Bluetooth connection is not that great. The Sony XM5 will produce a better sounding mic, however, even that is not great due to the limitations of Bluetooth technology. I've also experienced some audio cutouts when connected to multiple devices at once -- if you experience this I suggest disconnecting from all devices and connecting to only a single device at a time. Hopefully the next software update will completely fix this issue. In terms of future technology, I'm looking forward to Bluetooth LE Audio which should prove to be a big leap forward for Bluetooth devices in terms of streaming high fidelity mic and audio. Unfortunately, LE Audio will likely require new hardware so it may be quite some time before we can reap the benefits.

I got these because they supposedly had decent noise canceling, and they were light weight.The noise cancelling is pretty good, and you can't really hear much at all if you have music on, but you can still hear everything (just muffled) with no sound playing. Which is ideal for me, and something I really like about this product.They are also not that heavy, and don't give me awful headaches like a lot of headphones do.The sound quality is also GREAT.The only downsides are that the mic is a little quiet, and you won't be able to be heard over the phone on a windy day. And they aren't super tight on my head, so they do fall off easy if you're doing even light jogging.They also connect to your devices pretty quickly, especially if you use the same device over and over. The only problem is when someone decides to borrow them, and then it has to test that connection first the next time you pick them up. Even WORSE if they're in the room because they will constantly connect to that device haha.That being said, I use these at my desk, and to walk to class all the time. The battery lasts ages (although it does take a little while to charge), and they're super comfortable. The case also keeps them nicely packed, and they are much sturdier than they look. I usually just put them around my neck to leave the house, and honestly I have had no problems with that in terms of wear.I've had them for a little over a year now, and I use them just about every day, and they are showing ZERO signs of wear or tear. I would HIGHLY recommend these.

I did a lot of research looking into bluetooth headphones; as someone with hearing damage and is very picky about how their headphones rest on their ears, I knew I couldn't settle. I bought various other pairs before trying Bose Quiet Comfort, such as KVIDIO (Not tight to head/sound leaking, bassy sound), Sennheiser 350BT (Pinched my ears, quieter than other sets, could hear myself in calls and couldn't turn off in app), and Soundcore Q35 (Entirely different sound depending on the device and if plugged in, couldn't listen to music and be in voice call at same time without plugging in), all of which had their dilemmas. I really wanted a nice pair of bluetooth headphones for cheap, but in my search I recognized that wasn't possible, so I saved up what I had and thankfully snagged this on discount (bought for $180).The sound is absolutely immersive; my worries about these headphones was that the bass was going to be too heavy, as SONY bluetooth headphones and other sets in this price range are usually very bass heavy. Fortunately, that wasn't the case with Quiet Comfort; it's strong, but it doesn't overpower. The mids and treble sound great too, and I can't say I've had any issues with listening to music, calls with friends, etc, other than those friends having shoddy microphones (No problem though).The fit on this set is also solid; I have noticed in warmer weather that my ears get sweaty, but that's to be expected with any headset that's over-ear. My only note is that I noticed the inside of the headphones have molded to my ear. When I first got them, the meshy material with the L and R was flat, but now it's slightly caved in. I'm not sure if it's impacted anything, because I haven't heard a difference in sound, and they don't feel different. I will keep an eye on it for when I update this review.The controls are simple, a switch on button and three buttons to turn up, down, pause, and skip music (and if on mobile, to use your voice assistant) on the right cuff. On the left, the only button is the noise cancelling (two settings; aware and noise-cancel). I enjoy that this headset has two ports, one for charging, and another to plug them into the device to use instead of bluetooth. However, I will note to anyone that uses these headphones plugged in; when the set is in wired mode, it disables bluetooth, and when still on it sounds incredibly quiet. And, when turned off and plugged in, the EQ and Stereo Sound disable, so using the headphones without them being on is really rough. These doesn't steer me away from using them though, as I mainly use them on and via bluetooth. I mean, to be honest, who uses bluetooth headphones with a wire anyway unless they're dead?I'm also actually pretty impressed by the battery on these. They last me all day and night, and I plug them in when I sleep. They charge really fast, and I've only had two occasions of low battery, mainly due to me forgetting to charge em.Overall, my only worry onward is the deterioration, if there is any, and possible connection issues. Haven't had those yet, and hopefully I won't in a year.

My Bose QuietComfort 45 Wireless Bluetooth Noise Cancelling Headphones arrived a bit later than promised. Additionally, I bought them as new, but noticed the box had been opened, the instructions loose and a wrapper for the optional cords had been ripped off. I was definitely of the mind to return them and complain. However I inspected them for tell-tale signs of use, they appeared mint and figured I would at least try them out.I connected them via bluetooth to my android phone, LG OLED TV, and my computer. All three sounded fantastic. When the bass kicked in during a movie it was outstanding. Bluetooth word/mouth sync on some shows was off but not on the majority of what I viewed. I did not experience noise issues, signal loss or any other negatives mentioned in other reviews. And they are unbelievably comfortable for extended periods of time. Battery life is very good. I've used them for 8 hours at a stretch and still had quite a bit of juice.So I decided to keep them despite the initial open box disappointment. They were not advertised by Amazon as refurbished and definitely not offered at the refurbished price. But I know quality when I hear it. My other headphones are Grado's and they are a good comparison indicator (although open ear).The ability to wander around and filter out noisy neighbors with these is worth the price alone. That I can go jogging, watch movies or sit around in perfect quiet comfort and work the New York Times puzzles and games is priceless.

I purchased this specifically to use on long flights and for that purpose it works very well. The noise canceling is very good at eliminating outside noise. These have an ""aware mode"" which allows you to hear outside noise while you have them on but, you have to click it manually (which to be clear is not that big of a deal for me but some other headphones can  do so automatically when it detects you speaking) My one dislike would be that it does not automatically pause whatever you're listening to automatically when you remove the headphones, which is a feature I've found common from others, especially at this price point.Sound is decent, they are bose so you should expect clean, crisp and quality sound. My personal preference is bass heavy sound for my headphones, while these do have some pep to them, it is not even comparable to my Sony xm4.Overall I really love how comfortable these are, I've always disliked over ear headphones as they would often (and quickly) get uncomfortable on your ears/head. I've been pleasantly surprised to have worn these for 10 + hour flights non stop and I've never felt any discomfort.Battery life is amazing, do these even die on standby? The headphones tell you how much charge is left every time you put them on. As I mentioned before, I've worn these on 10+ hour flights and they've lasted throughout the entire trip with constant noise canceling active. When not in use, I feel like this battery does not even deplete at all.These headphones come with a wired option as well as Bluetooth. I personally never had to use the wired since i've never had them die on me.The case it comes in is really nice. This is usually one of the things I would ditch but I've found myself using them all the time. It is a hard cover case and provides some nice protection for your headphones. I always store them in there now whenever I'm not using it.Bottom line?ProsVERY comfortableLong battery life with quick chargingExcellent Noise cancelingCan use with wire or BluetoothConsDoes not automatically pause music when you take them off.Does not have a feature to disable noise canceling when it detects you talkingFinal thoughts: Every review on here regarding sound quality would be subjective to the user as everyone has different preferences, with that said here is my opinion.They can get nice and loud but I've found them to be very trebble heavy even when you adjust the settings in app to lower it. My personal preference is bass heavy music and these do not give me that crisp boom that I crave when listening even when bass boost is selected on the eq in-app.Overall sound quality is fairly balanced with highs being more dominant. I use them all the time but really wish I could squeeze more bass out of them.

Sound quality is great, comfortable to wear. Worth the money

I recently took a 5 hour flight and boy! let me tell you the noise cancellation is great! So great in fact, I could not hear the flight attendants when it was beverage time. Listening to music or videos was like being at home (my home is quiet🙂). I should have used them on the cruise as my travel companion was a loud non-stop yipper, but I didn’t want to be rude. The battery life was excellent.  If you are looking for a reasonably priced noise canceling head phone I highly recommend these.

Super comfortable.  Sound is impeccable.  Wow.  This is a first pair of Bose for me, and again, WOW.  I don't know that I can ever go back to any other product!  They are almost too good at blocking out outside noise even on ""aware"" mode.  Sometimes I just put them on to not be bothered by anyone or hear anything (without playing any music or white noise).  Either way (with or without music) these headphones will put you in your own undisturbed world.  Worth the money.  Love that they come with a protective case.They auto connect to my phone when I turn them on.  I don't have to select it.  This applies each time I use the Bose headphones, otherwise I need to disconnect and connect to my other device I am going to use.  But it beats having to manually connect to your phone all the time.Spend the money.  You won't regret it!

My previous review is gone. NO idea why. It was a 5-star review, and I gushed about how the headphones were really really great, they saved my life as someone with noise sensitivity and evil roommates and thin walls, and the only issue I had was that every time you turned them on a dead, soul-grating robotic female voice lists out every single device you are now connected to. Every. Single. One. And apparently you have to go into an app to change that, which just doesn't seem like a good idea at all - personally, I would download the app and then uninstall it, since that's not a good enough reason for me to keep the app there. But anyway. If this is a dealbreaker for you try something else. If you can deal with it, you'll probably be very happy with the headphones. This better not be removed again, there's no good reason for it. -1 star because this probably very minor flaw has become increasingly annoying and has impacted my enjoyment of this product - hopefully it won't get worse!

I am going to have to go with the QC45's for noise canceling but the Sony is better on sound.  Much better.  I am writing this review because I really struggled with which pair to buy.  Ended up trying both, so I hope this helps others who are on the fence.  First it is worth noting that I had to return the Sony's because they hurt my ears.  There is something somewhat pointy behind the cloth and it kept pressure on my outer ear.  Got really uncomfortable after wearing for 15 minutes or so.  Also, there was something wrong with the Bluetooth.  The sound was lacking and hollow like you were listening in a barrel.  It only did this over Bluetooth, not when using the cord.  For these reasons I returned them.  I read all the reviews that were available on the QC45 and they all basically said the same thing.  Noise canceling is awesome.  Sound quality is lacking - especially the base.  I can definitely confirm this is true.  Having compared both headsets in the same listening conditions and same music, it is very obvious.  First, the QC45 noise canceling is just better.  It muted out my droning refrigerator whereas the Sony didn't quite do as well.  Don't get me wrong, though, the Sony noise canceling is excellent.  The QC45 is just a little better.  I can also confirm the QC45 has a slight ""white noise"" sound when the room is quiet.  But it does not bother me and is no worse than my previous JVC noise canceling headphones.  It is actually kinda soothing.  I can confirm that there is more room in the QC45s.  They do not hurt my ears.  I am not having the weird hollow sounding Bluetooth issues on the QC45 that I experienced with the Sony's.But when it comes to listening to music, this is where the Sony's do a much better job.  I want to be clear that the issue for me is primarily the lack of base.  I know I read this was an issue, but I expected that the QC45s  would still have good base, and it was the brain thumping base folks who were the ones commenting it was lacking base.  I suspected it might be just fine for my needs.  I have to be honest here folks.... the base is just NOT there.  Its just not.  Not only is the base not there, the folks at Bose definitely tune these on the bright side.  The treble is just a little too high for me at the volume I like to listen at.  You can turn the volume down and this subsides, but that is a poor way to have to deal with headphones that are tuned just one way - bright.  Bose really blew it here.  The lack of base at the bright highs could have been easlily solved if I could have adjusted them via the Bose app....but no, the marketing folks had to make them look like the ""cheaper model"" compared to the 700's.  Wake up Bose.  Nobody likes the same kind of sound.  An equalizer is an absolute must.  You are and will continue to lose business on the QC45's unless you release an upgrade that allows QC45 folks to access the same type of equalizer that the 700 folks have.  Just sayin......The other annoying things for me are the inability to quickly check the battery life and the music pause when you remove the headphones.  The Sony's let you check battery life with a quick button push.  I used this feature all the time.  Not so on the QC45's.  You have to log into your phone app to see this.  Well this does no good when you are working on your laptop.  Switching back and forth between laptop listening and phone listening was a bit more seamless and easy on the Sony's, too.  The music pause that was available on the Sony's turned out to be really useful.  I found myself taking the headphones on and off a lot during the work day.  Pausing whatever was streaming was great.  That great feature is missing on the QC45's.  Overall I have to say both were great.  My advice is go with the QC45 if noise canceling is most important.  Go with the Sony's if the sound quality is more important.
